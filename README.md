# Pacman game in JavaScript

I made this game during a Front End Developer Bootcamp on www.scrimba.com, after I built the foundations with some help, I added some styling and features to the webpage

The teacher of this Module was Ania Kubow (https://github.com/kubowania)

Here is the final page: https://arturfriedrich.github.io/pacmanJS/
